SILENT PRAYER

Father, it is good to sit in silence with you to ground myself in your being, your way of life and thinking and feeling. I quiet myself just to orient myself so that your operating system can be up and running within my being. So I can intentionally be attached to you and be _**in Christ**_ all day today. Or, as my spiritual director says, at least for the next ten minutes live in the kingdom of love.

**Interactive Gratitude**

Father, I am grateful for 2 nights of good sleep in a row. My willingness to co-operate with you in going to bed at a good time is a fruitful way of living. Thank you!

Jesus, I am so thankful for the brothers that I spent time with yesterday morning and lunch. What a rich time of being together, sharing where we are, praying for one another and encouraging one another.

_John, I'm glad you kept turning your attention to my Spirit throughout the day. Especially when you were in traffic concerned about being late. I know that was a challenging time, but your desire to be with me in that is what I'm appreciating._

**Living Word - God speaks** - John 15:10-12 **Common English Bible (CEB)**

**10 **If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I kept my Father's commandments and remain in his love. **11 **I have said these things to you so that my joy will be in you and your joy will be complete. **12 **This is my commandment: love each other just as I have loved you.

**Living Conversation (Stood out to me + Response)**

Jesus, I can, and often, make my home here. These verses anchor so much of my being and my thinking. Just reading these with you and soaking in them give life to my soul.

The words that stand out to me in these 3 verses:

*   * love (4x)
  * commandments (3x)
  * joy (2x)

As I listen to you and your heart, your love is revealed in participating with you in the wisdom and life of your commandments. And, you've given us these ways of living so that our joy will be complete, full, overflowing.

You love us.

You give us the gift of the beautiful and good life revealed in the way of living (commands).

This leads us to experiencing your goodness and power (grace) and our experiential response is joy.

Jesus, today, I anticipate the joy of loving the people you've given me today.

_Yes, John, this is life in me. Your desire reveals a deeply seated yes in your soul to my invitation to love. When you live in this way you are participating in my divine nature. And, when you participate with me in my nature you become like me as you become like the one you love._

> _\*NOTE\*_
> 
> _This humble attempt to hear what God might be saying to me helps me to stay in an interactive relationship with Jesus. It should always resonate with the character of God as revealed in all of scripture and in Jesus Christ. If it doesn't I need to be corrected and guided back to who God says God is. Please help me stay on the narrow path if you ever see me doing or saying something that does not resonate with the Mind of Christ._

> _I share this with you because interacting with Jesus like this helps me to do the Father's will even when its tough._
